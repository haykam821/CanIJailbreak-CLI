## Installation

This command-line tool is extremely easy to install. Just make sure you have `npm` installed and run:

    git://github.com/haykam821/CanIJailbreak-CLI.git#latest

Afterwards, you can access the command-line tool.

## Usage

This tool has multiple aliases, but they all work the same:

* `canijailbreak`
* `canijb`
* `cijb`

There are two subcommands, `info` and `exists`. Both take the same first argument: an iOS version.
